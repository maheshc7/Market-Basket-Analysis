# Market-Basket-Analysis
This project contains the Market Basked Analysis done using Apriori Algorithm over two different transactional datset:

1.One dataset contains the transactions over a period of 1 week of an retial store. It contains the every transaction taken place over the week, each row represents one transaction.

2.The other dataset is of an online store and the database consist the details of the purchases along with customer detail, product detail, mode of payment, country etc.


We use pandas library and OneHotTransaction to preprocess the dataset.
Mlxtend library is used for calculating the freqnet datasets and therefore finding out the association rules amongst them.
For plotting the graphs matplotlib is being used.
Here we have take 'lift' as the evalution metric(feel free to experiment with the values).
